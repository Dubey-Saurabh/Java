"Sanity Vs. Smoke Testing"

Smoke Testing:
1. Smoke Testing is performed to make sure that the critical functionalities of the program is working fine.
2. It's a subset of acceptance testing.
3. This testing is performed by the developers or testers
4. It exercises the entire system from end to end and is like General Health Check Up
Example: Testing login, homepage load, and critical navigation to verify stability before moving forward.
When: Performed on new builds to check if the software is stable for further testing.

Sanity Testing:
1. Sanity Testing is preformed  to check the new functionality/bugs have been fixed.
2. It's a subset of regression testing
3. This is usually performed by testers
4. It exercises only the particular component of the entire system and is like specialized health check up
Example: If a login bug is fixed, sanity testing would confirm that the login feature works as expected without testing the entire application.
When: Conducted after minor changes or fixes to ensure the targeted area is functioning as intended.

Regression testing:
1. verifies that new changes to an application do not affect existing features.
2. Regression testing ensures that new features don't break existing features.
3. Regression testing is usually run at the end of a development sprint
