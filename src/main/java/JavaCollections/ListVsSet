List : a) The list implementation allows us to add the same or duplicate elements.
       b) The insertion order is maintained by the List.
       c) List allows us to add any number of null values.
       d) The List implementation classes are LinkedList and ArrayList.
       e) We can get the element of a specified index from the list using the get() method.
       f) It is used when we want to frequently access the elements by using the index.

Set :  a) The set implementation doesn't allow us to add the same or duplicate elements.
       b) It doesn't maintain the insertion order of elements.
       c) Set allows us to add at least one null value in it.
       d) The Set implementation classes are TreeSet, HashSet and LinkedHashSet.
       e) We cannot find the element from the Set based on the index because it doesn't provide any get method().
       f) It is used when we want to design a collection of distinct elements.
