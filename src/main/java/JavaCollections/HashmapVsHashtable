Hashmap : a) HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe.
          b) HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
          c) HashMap is fast.
          d) We can make the HashMap as synchronized by calling this code
             Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(hashMap);
          e) HashMap is traversed by Iterator.
          
Hashtable : a) Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe.

            c) Hashtable is slow.
            d) Hashtable is internally synchronized and can't be unsynchronized.
            e) Hashtable is traversed by Enumerator and Iterator.
