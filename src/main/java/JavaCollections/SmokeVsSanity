Smoke testing : a) It is a broad approach to testing where all parts of the application are tested.
                b) It measures the stability of the system by performing rigorous testing.
                c) It is performed by both testers and developers.
                d) Testing is done without getting into deep but whenever needed tester has to go into deep.
                e) Smoke testing is the first testing performed on the initial build.
                f) Smoke testing is documented.
                g) It is used to test End to End function of the application.
                h) It is considered as a subset of acceptance testing.
                
Sanity testing : a) It is a narrow approach to testing where specific parts of the application are tested.
                 b) Sanity testing can be done without test cases or scripts.
                 c) It is performed by only testers.
                 e) Sanity testing does not need to go into deep of the application.
                 f) Sanity testing is performed when the build is comparatively stable.
                 g) Sanity testing is not documented.
                 h) It is used to test only modified or defect fixed functions.
                 i) It is considered as a subset of regression testing.
